#Poisson distribution for dissimilar read sizes
Because of the dissimilar read sizes in sequencing protocol, we tested our datasets using Poisson test as noises in a sequencing experiment should be Poisson distributed. For replicates giving an estimate of expression for a given gene, they should be independently identically distributed from a Poisson distribution of rate lambda (up to library size scaling). 
To easily check this for individual gene in our dataset, an example is to use the 'poisson.test' function in R; let's say for isoform LOC_Os01g01010.1 we have 573 reads from rep1 and 684 reads from rep2, then we estimated the library scaling factor as 13617386, 21700740 for rep1 and rep2, respectively.
poisson.test(c(573, 684), c(13617386, 21700740)) gives a p-value of 4.414e-07 for the null hypothesis that they have the same rate ratio:

> poisson.test(c(573, 684), c(13617386, 21700740)) 
Comparison of Poisson rates
data:  c(573, 684) time base: c(13617386, 21700740)
count1 = 573, expected count1 = 484.65, p-value = 4.414e-07
alternative hypothesis: true rate ratio is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 1.192649 1.493904
sample estimates:
rate ratio 
  1.334994

Of course, in high-throughput sequencing experiments you expect many small p-values by chance so we corrected for multiple testing to see what is significant when testing all genes.
